            <p><strong>About</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The founders and creative directors of the brand, Ahsen Uğurlu and Duygu Alptekin, have prepared women's and men's clothing collections for various European brands for many years. In 2012, they founded the haute couture workshop in Nişantaşı, Istanbul, which they named "JU ISTANBUL", inspired by the mysterious city where they started their brand journey. Their muse was the elegant and feminine women of the 1950s. For the duo, creating timeless pieces that bear traces of current trends with the quality of fabric and stitching, but can still be worn with pleasure after many years has always been at the forefront.</li>
                <li>The brand, which prepared its first wedding dress collection in 2016, attracted great attention with the detailed embroidery, lace embroidery and designs that emphasize both romantic and femininity, which have become its signature in couture collections.</li>
                <li>In 2020, JU ISTANBUL renewed its name as MAISON JU in the process of adapting to its creative vision that goes beyond its geographical borders, and opened its first sales point abroad in Munich, Germany.</li>
                <li>Inspired by the more current and energetic JU woman, as well as their couture work, they created the JU STUDIO ready-to-wear series.</li>
                <li>MAISON JU and JU STUDIO continue to reach all over the world with their personalized designs and ready-to-wear collections.</li>
